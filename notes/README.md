Some updates on the project: 

- I think the spatial transmission model is no longer necessary. I just can't see us using it to meaningfully say anything about the timing and location of introductions, since it's not clear that a future influenza pandemic will spread like the last one. But, I do think that the local-level model could still be useful, and there's still a geographic analysis to be done. We should just look at the impact on food production of an outbreak in various counties, at different times of year. 
- It would be nice, too, to incorporate some of the information from Zia's FoodTwin project. Beyond the impact on food production, what might be the impact on downstream food availability? Basically, adding a disease layer to their map.
